# Control Module

DAO core to create organizations with their segregated treasury and maintain members

## Overview

Control is a wrapper for organizationsal bodies in the chain.

Organizations consist of members as individual users/accounts.

Every organization has attached treasury, which is managed collectively by its members with help of related modules.


### Terminology

* **Organizations controller:** Admin of the organization.
* **Organizations access model:** How users may apply to the organization.
	* `Open` - any user may join;
	* `Voting` - user may join only if organization members allow it by voting;
	* `Controller` - user may be invited by org controller.
* **Organizations treasury:** Account, where all organization funds are stored for further management.
Interaction with the treasury happens only with collective decisions, approved by organization members.
* **Organizations fee:** amount of protocol tokens to be locked/transfered from the user, once he joins the organization.

Control is designed to make the following possible:

* Allow users to create organizations with specified options.
* Provide organizations with individual treasury account.
* Allow users to become a members of organizations.
