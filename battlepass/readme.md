## Overview

BattlePass is a subscription based engagement protocol for gaming guilds. It enables claiming and dropping rewards based on completing quests. These achievements are based on verifiable activity and contribute to xp, rep, trust in SENSE.


## BattlePass for DAOs

	1. It can be invoked by a DAO through staking (1000) GAME token on the protocol treasury.

	2. Staking automatically enables the BattlePass section in a DAO.

	3. The DAO invoking wishing to enable BattlePass needs verified credentials and be in good standing:
		- (XP) > (100)
		- (REP) > (100)
		- (TRUST) > (100)
		- MEMBERS > 10

BattlePass starts operating immediately when the staking deposit has been transferred. To make proper use of it, some defaults are in place to make it work:

	- By default a BattlePass utilizes xp,rep,trust in relation to a DAO

	- therefore a DAO specific map for xp,rep,trust has to be setup on DAO creation

	- a BP operates in seasons. a season is by default 100 days based on the respective blocktime of the host chain this results with 6s blocktime in in 10 * 60 * 24 = 14400 blocks per day and 144000 blocks per season.

	- after a season has finished, a new season starts, resetting the achieved score

	- a user subscribes for a BP over one to n seasons

	- a user collects points during the season based on their verifiable activity in games, on socials, etc

	- based on a score table, user is allowed to claim rewards from a level L and can use points P to claim rewards up to level L

	- P are calculated based on a formula like:

	*** DRAFT ***

		P =
			MAP *
			( 1 * subscription_mul ) +	-> local
			0 * (						-> activated?
				1 +
				XP( season ) *			-> local
				( 1 + REP / 100 ) *		-> global
				( 1 + TRUST * 100 )		-> global
			)

		- where MAP is the individual mapping for achievements / levels, etc

		everybody can play, but only with a subscription you get the multiplier to make real progress into the claimable scores

	*** DRAFT ***

	- rewards will be delivered as nft based collectable, like
		- proof of achievement
		- proof of participation
		- ticket
		- collectable
		...

	- DAO needs to create a reward map based on a
		score_threshold ST,
		a reward object R,
		a price in points P:

				{ ST ,  ( R , P ) }

example: 		1000, ( item_drop_dragonball_nft, 0 )
