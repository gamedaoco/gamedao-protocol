# GAMEDAO PROTOCOL

GameDAO Protocol is a toolbox to enable setup and operation of unstoppable on chain collectives. It offers governance via proposals for members of a collective, helping to notarize and enforce decisions, e.g. treasury spending. Collectives can also fundraise through the protocol, enabling them to kickstart their efforts.
