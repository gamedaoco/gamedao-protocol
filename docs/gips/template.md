# GIP-XXX: [Short Title]

> **GameDAO Improvement Proposal Template**

## Header
- **GIP Number**: XXX (assigned by maintainers)
- **Title**: [Short descriptive title]
- **Author**: [Name and contact]
- **Category**: [Core Protocol | Frontend | Infrastructure | Standards]
- **Status**: [Draft | Review | Accepted | Implemented | Rejected]
- **Created**: [Date]
- **Updated**: [Date]

## Summary
*One paragraph explanation of the feature or improvement.*

## Abstract
*A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.*

## Motivation
*The motivation is critical for GIPs that want to change the GameDAO Protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the GIP solves.*

## Specification
*The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.*

### Technical Details
- **Affected Modules**: [List of modules that will be modified]
- **New Components**: [List of new components to be added]
- **API Changes**: [List of API changes]
- **Breaking Changes**: [List of breaking changes, if any]

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: [Description]
2. **Phase 2**: [Description]
3. **Phase 3**: [Description]

## Rationale
*The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made.*

## Backwards Compatibility
*All GIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.*

## Test Cases
*Test cases for implementation are mandatory for GIPs that are affecting consensus changes.*

## Implementation
*The implementation must be completed before any GIP is given status "Implemented".*

## Security Considerations
*All GIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.*

## References
*Links to external references, standards, or related GIPs.*

## GIP Process

### 1. Idea Stage
- Discuss the idea in GameDAO Discord/Forum
- Gather initial feedback
- Refine the concept

### 2. Draft Stage
- Create GIP using this template
- Submit PR to docs/gips/draft/
- Assign GIP number (next available)

### 3. Review Stage
- Technical review by core team
- Community feedback period (minimum 2 weeks)
- Address feedback and iterate

### 4. Final Stage
- Final review by maintainers
- Decision: Accepted or Rejected
- Move to appropriate folder

### 5. Implementation Stage
- Implementation begins
- Progress tracked in GIP
- Testing and validation

### 6. Completion
- Implementation complete
- Documentation updated
- Status changed to "Implemented"

## GIP Categories

### Core Protocol
- Smart contract changes
- Module modifications
- Consensus mechanisms
- Protocol upgrades

### Frontend
