# GIP-001: Unified Documentation System

> **GameDAO Improvement Proposal for Comprehensive Documentation Restructuring**

## Header
- **GIP Number**: 001
- **Title**: Unified Documentation System
- **Author**: GameDAO Protocol Team
- **Category**: Infrastructure
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created**: 2024-12-21
- **Updated**: 2024-12-21

## Summary
Establish a unified documentation system that consolidates all GameDAO Protocol documentation into three main sections (Development, Protocol, Product) with a structured GIP system for future improvements, replacing the current scattered documentation across logs and packages.

## Abstract
The current GameDAO Protocol documentation is fragmented across multiple locations including a logs/ folder with 30+ numbered files, scattered package READMEs, and minimal structure in the main docs/ folder. This proposal creates a comprehensive, navigable documentation system that serves as a single source of truth for all protocol development, technical specifications, and product requirements.

## Motivation
The existing documentation structure creates several problems:
1. **Fragmentation**: Information scattered across logs/, packages/, and docs/
2. **Poor Discoverability**: No clear navigation or structure
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Difficult to keep documentation current
4. **Inconsistent Quality**: Varying formats and levels of detail
5. **Historical Context Loss**: Planning artifacts mixed with current documentation
6. **No Improvement Process**: No structured way to propose documentation improvements

A unified system addresses these issues by providing clear organization, consistent formatting, and structured processes for maintenance and improvement.

## Specification

### Technical Details
- **Affected Modules**: All documentation across the repository
- **New Components**:
  - Unified docs/ structure with Development, Protocol, Product sections
  - GIP (GameDAO Improvement Proposal) system
  - Product History (PH) numbering system
  - Migration scripts and templates
- **API Changes**: None (documentation only)
- **Breaking Changes**: None (existing files remain, new structure added)

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Structure Creation**
   - Create unified docs/ directory structure
   - Establish GIP system with template and processes
   - Create migration mapping and scripts

2. **Phase 2: Content Migration**
   - Migrate logs/ content to appropriate sections
   - Update package documentation references
   - Create product history from chronological logs

3. **Phase 3: GIP System Population**
   - Convert future roadmap items to GIPs
   - Create initial GIPs for major planned features
   - Establish review and approval processes

### GIP Numbering System
- **Format**: GIP-XXX (three-digit number + short title)
- **Categories**: Core Protocol, Frontend, Infrastructure, Standards
- **Status Flow**: Draft → Review → Accepted → Implemented
- **Review Process**: Technical review + community feedback (2+ weeks)

### Product History System
- **Format**: PH-XXX (Product History with three-digit number)
- **Content**: Chronological migration of logs/ content
- **Context**: Historical planning artifacts and development journey
- **Value**: Maintains institutional knowledge and decision context

## Rationale
This design provides several key benefits:

1. **Clear Organization**: Three-section structure (Development, Protocol, Product) maps to different user needs
2. **Structured Improvement**: GIP system provides clear process for proposing and implementing changes
3. **Historical Context**: Product History maintains the valuable planning artifacts from logs/
4. **Scalability**: Structure can grow with the protocol
5. **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and update processes
6. **Discoverability**: Hierarchical structure with proper navigation

The GIP system is modeled after successful improvement proposal systems (EIPs, BIPs) but adapted for GameDAO's specific needs including product and infrastructure changes.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal maintains full backwards compatibility:
- All existing files remain in their current locations
- New documentation structure is additive
- Existing links continue to work
- Migration is non-destructive (copies content, doesn't move/delete)

## Test Cases
N/A - This is a documentation infrastructure change with no code impact.

## Implementation
Implementation consists of:
1. **Directory Structure**: Create complete docs/ structure
2. **Content Migration**: Migrate existing documentation with proper categorization
3. **GIP System**: Implement proposal system with template and processes
4. **Navigation**: Create clear navigation and cross-references
5. **Maintenance**: Establish ongoing maintenance processes

## Security Considerations
This proposal has no direct security implications as it only affects documentation structure. However, it provides security benefits by:
- Centralizing security documentation for easier maintenance
- Establishing clear processes for documenting security changes
- Providing structured way to propose and review security improvements
