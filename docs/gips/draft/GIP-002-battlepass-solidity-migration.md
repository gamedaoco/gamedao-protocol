# GIP-002: Battlepass Solidity Migration

## Abstract

This proposal outlines the migration of the GameDAO Battlepass module from its current Substrate implementation to a Solidity-based smart contract system. The migration will enable broader ecosystem compatibility, enhanced user experience, and seamless integration with the existing GameDAO protocol architecture.

## Motivation

### Current Challenges
1. **Limited Ecosystem Integration**: The Substrate implementation restricts integration with the broader Ethereum ecosystem
2. **User Experience Barriers**: Complex onboarding for users unfamiliar with Substrate-based systems
3. **Developer Accessibility**: Limited developer pool familiar with Substrate compared to Solidity
4. **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Difficulty in extending to other EVM-compatible chains

### Strategic Benefits
1. **Ecosystem Expansion**: Access to the entire Ethereum DeFi and gaming ecosystem
2. **Enhanced Liquidity**: Integration with existing DEXs and NFT marketplaces
3. **Developer Adoption**: Larger pool of Solidity developers for community contributions
4. **Multi-chain Strategy**: Foundation for deployment across multiple EVM chains

## Specification

### Core Features to Migrate

#### 1. Quest & Achievement System
Based on the existing design specifications:

**Quest Components:**
- **Verifiable Activity Tracking**: Integration with Discord, Twitter, Twitch, and game APIs
- **Multi-platform Verification**: Social proof mechanisms for quest completion
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Escalating quest complexity throughout seasons
- **Community Quests**: Guild-based collaborative challenges

**Achievement Framework:**
- **NFT-based Achievements**: Immutable proof of accomplishment
- **Composable Rewards**: Modular achievement components
- **Transferable/Non-transferable**: Configurable transfer restrictions
- **Achievement Templates**: Reusable achievement structures

#### 2. Seasonal Progression System

**Season Mechanics:**
- **100-day Seasons**: Configurable season duration (default 100 days)
- **Automatic Reset**: Score reset with season transitions
- **Cross-season Persistence**: Reputation and achievements carry forward
- **Season-specific Rewards**: Unique rewards per season

**Progression Formula:**
```solidity
// Enhanced points calculation based on design spec
function calculatePoints(
    uint256 localXP,
    uint256 globalREP,
    uint256 globalTRUST,
    uint256 subscriptionMultiplier,
    uint256 achievementMapping
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return achievementMapping * (
        subscriptionMultiplier +
        (localXP * (1 + globalREP / 100) * (1 + globalTRUST / 100))
    );
}
```

#### 3. Subscription & Payment System

**Payment Options:**
- **FIAT Integration**: PSP integration for traditional payments
- **Stablecoin Support**: USDT, USDC, DAI acceptance
- **ETH Payments**: Native cryptocurrency support
- **Multi-season Subscriptions**: 1-n season subscription options

**Pricing Structure:**
- **Individual Subscriptions**: Per-user seasonal access
- **Guild Packages**: Bulk subscriptions for organizations
- **Tiered Access**: Different subscription levels with varying benefits

#### 4. DAO Integration Requirements

**Organization Prerequisites:**
- **GAME Token Staking**: 1000 GAME tokens required for battlepass activation
- **Reputation Thresholds**: Minimum XP (100), REP (100), TRUST (100)
- **Member Requirements**: Minimum 10 active members
- **Good Standing**: No recent violations or penalties

**Automated Activation:**
- **Instant Deployment**: Battlepass available immediately after staking
- **Default Configuration**: Pre-configured settings for immediate use
- **Customization Options**: Post-deployment configuration flexibility

#### 5. Social Integration Layer

**Account Connections:**
- **Discord Integration**: Primary verification method
- **Twitter Verification**: Social proof and engagement tracking
- **Twitch Integration**: Streaming activity verification
- **Wallet Connection**: Web3 identity anchoring
- **Extended Integrations**: Expandable to additional platforms

**Verification Framework:**
- **OAuth Integration**: Secure social account verification
- **Proof Generation**: Cryptographic proof of social activities
- **Privacy Controls**: User-controlled data sharing preferences
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous activity verification

### Technical Architecture

#### Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
contract Battlepass is GameDAOModule, IBattlepass {
    // Core battlepass management
    mapping(bytes32 => BattlepassData) public battlepasses;
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => UserProgress)) public userProgress;
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => QuestProgress)) public questProgress;

    // Social verification
    mapping(address => SocialConnections) public socialConnections;
    mapping(bytes32 => Quest) public quests;

    // Achievement system
    mapping(bytes32 => Achievement) public achievements;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) public userAchievements;

    // Season management
    mapping(bytes32 => SeasonData) public seasons;
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(uint256 => SeasonConfig)) public seasonConfigs;
}
```
