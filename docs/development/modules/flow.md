# Flow Module Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Flow module is GameDAO's comprehensive crowdfunding and campaign management system, supporting multiple funding models and reward mechanisms for gaming communities.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Flow Contract (750+ lines)**: Main implementation with all crowdfunding features
- **IFlow Interface (252 lines)**: Complete API definition with events and functions
- **Campaign Management**: Full lifecycle from creation to finalization
- **Multi-token Support**: ETH and ERC20 token contributions
- **Reward Distribution**: Proportional token rewards for successful campaigns

### Flow Types
The Flow module supports 6 distinct campaign types:

1. **Grant (0)**: Grant funding with no return expected
2. **Raise (1)**: Fundraising with token/equity return
3. **Lend (2)**: Lending with interest
4. **Loan (3)**: Borrowing funds
5. **Share (4)**: Revenue sharing
6. **Pool (5)**: Liquidity pooling

### Campaign States
Campaigns progress through a defined lifecycle:

1. **Created (0)**: Campaign created but not started
2. **Active (1)**: Campaign is live and accepting contributions
3. **Paused (2)**: Campaign temporarily paused by admin
4. **Succeeded (3)**: Campaign reached its minimum goal
5. **Failed (4)**: Campaign failed to reach minimum
6. **Locked (5)**: Campaign locked by admin
7. **Finalized (6)**: Campaign completed and funds distributed

## Key Features

### Campaign Creation
```solidity
function createCampaign(
    bytes32 organizationId,
    string memory title,
    string memory description,
    string memory metadataURI,
    FlowType flowType,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 target,
    uint256 min,
    uint256 max,
    uint256 duration,
    bool autoFinalize
) external returns (bytes32 campaignId)
```

**Parameters:**
- `organizationId`: Must be a valid organization from Control module
- `title`: Campaign title (required, non-empty)
- `description`: Detailed campaign description
- `metadataURI`: IPFS URI for additional metadata
- `flowType`: One of 6 supported flow types
- `paymentToken`: Address(0) for ETH, or ERC20 token address
- `target`: Target funding amount
- `min`: Minimum amount to consider campaign successful
- `max`: Maximum amount (0 for unlimited)
- `duration`: Campaign duration in seconds
- `autoFinalize`: Whether to auto-finalize when target is reached

### Contribution System
```solidity
function contribute(
    bytes32 campaignId,
    uint256 amount,
    string memory metadata
) external payable
```

**Features:**
- **ETH Contributions**: Send ETH directly with `msg.value`
- **ERC20 Contributions**: Automatic token transfer from contributor
- **Multiple Contributions**: Contributors can contribute multiple times
- **Contribution Tracking**: Complete history and metadata
- **Validation**: Amount limits, campaign state, and timing checks

### Protocol Fees
- **Default Rate**: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- **Maximum Rate**: 10% (1000 basis points)
- **Collection**: Automatic on campaign finalization
- **Recipient**: Configurable by admin
- **Calculation**: `(amount * feeRate) / 10000`

### Reward Distribution
```solidity
function distributeRewards(
    bytes32 campaignId,
    address rewardToken,
    uint256 totalRewardAmount
) external
```

**Features:**
- **Proportional Distribution**: Based on contribution amounts
- **Multiple Tokens**: Support for different reward tokens
- **Claim Mechanism**: Contributors claim their own rewards
- **Tracking**: Complete reward distribution analytics

### Access Control
- **FLOW_ADMIN_ROLE**: Protocol administration
- **CAMPAIGN_CREATOR_ROLE**: Campaign creation permissions
- **Creator Controls**: Campaign creators can update their campaigns
- **Admin Override**: Emergency controls and state management

## Integration

### Control Module Integration
```solidity
function _validateOrganization(bytes32 organizationId) internal view {
    address controlModule = getModule(keccak256("CONTROL"));
    if (controlModule == address(0)) revert OrganizationNotFound(organizationId);

    IControl control = IControl(controlModule);
    if (!control.isOrganizationActive(organizationId)) {
        revert OrganizationNotFound(organizationId);
    }
}
```

**Cross-Module Communication:**
- Organization validation through Control module
- Registry-based module discovery
- Shared access control patterns
- Event synchronization for subgraphs

### Registry Integration
- **Module ID**: `keccak256("FLOW")`
- **Automatic Initialization**: Registry calls `initialize()` on registration
- **Role Management**: Registry receives admin roles
- **Lifecycle Management**: Enable/disable through registry

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **OpenZeppelin AccessControl**: Role-based permissions
- **Custom Roles**: FLOW_ADMIN_ROLE, CAMPAIGN_CREATOR_ROLE
- **Creator Permissions**: Campaign creators can update their campaigns
- **Admin Override**: Protocol admins can manage any campaign

### Financial Security
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **SafeERC20**: Secure token transfers
- **Amount Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **State Checks**: Campaign state and timing validation

### Emergency Controls
- **Pausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Admin Controls**: Campaign state override
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: Admin can withdraw funds in emergencies
- **Protocol Fee Limits**: Maximum 10% fee protection
