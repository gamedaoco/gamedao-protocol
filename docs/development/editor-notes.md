- lets use for newly created orgs, campaigns, profiles a default bg image for the overview, when the user does not upload one. it is located in packages/frontend/public/splash.png
- lets use the initials of an org as default profile pic if none was uploaded.
- lets add to our default overview. layout the capability to switch between list view and grid / card view
- i suggest apart from the frontend topic to also run the testnet node via docker, so we can remove this as a bottleneck.
- 1where do we store the ipfs hash for the respective detailed information of each organization, campaign and profile? is it already part of the process and hooks?
