# GameDAO Protocol - Historical Logs

This directory contains the complete historical development logs from the GameDAO Protocol project. These logs document the evolution of the protocol from initial concept through implementation of the core modules.

## Purpose

These logs serve as:
- **Historical Record**: Complete development timeline and decision history
- **Reference Material**: Technical analysis and implementation details
- **Learning Resource**: Understanding the protocol's evolution and design decisions
- **Migration Source**: Content being migrated to the unified documentation system

## Organization

The logs are organized chronologically with the following naming convention:
- `000-099`: Foundation and core development
- `100-199`: Frontend and user interface development
- `200-299`: Integration and optimization (reserved for future use)

## Migration Status

These logs are being systematically migrated to the unified documentation system:

### **âœ… Migrated**
- Core module documentation â†’ `docs/development/modules/`
- Product history â†’ `docs/product/history/`
- Technical analysis â†’ `docs/development/architecture/`
- Setup guides â†’ `docs/development/getting-started.md`

### **ðŸ“‹ Migration Mapping**
See `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for the complete migration mapping and timeline.

## Usage Guidelines

### **For Developers**
- Use these logs to understand historical context and decisions
- Reference implementation details for similar work
- Learn from past challenges and solutions

### **For Product Teams**
- Track feature evolution and requirements
- Understand user stories and acceptance criteria
- Reference testing and validation approaches

### **For Documentation**
- Source material for updating current documentation
- Historical context for feature decisions
- Examples of successful documentation patterns

## Maintenance

This directory is maintained as a historical archive:
- **No new files** should be added to this directory
- **Existing files** should not be modified
- **New development logs** should be created in the appropriate `docs/` sections
- **Migration work** should reference but not modify these files

## Access

All logs are preserved in their original format for:
- Historical accuracy
- Technical reference
- Migration source material
- Learning and training purposes
