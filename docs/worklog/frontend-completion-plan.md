4. **Create task tracking** - Use GitHub issues or project board
5. **Set up continuous integration** - Automated testing and deployment

## 📝 **Notes**

- **Contract Integration**: All contracts are deployed and tested (154/154 tests passing)
- **Subgraph**: Ready and indexed, just needs frontend integration testing
- **Design System**: Radix UI provides solid foundation, just needs consistency
- **Performance**: Good foundation with Next.js, just needs optimization

## 🎉 **Expected Outcome**

By the end of 5 weeks, GameDAO will have:
- **Production-ready frontend** with all features working
- **Comprehensive testing** ensuring reliability
- **Professional UI/UX** ready for public launch
- **Full Web3 integration** with simplified contracts
- **Mobile-optimized** experience
- **Documentation** for users and developers

The frontend will be ready for **testnet launch** after Week 2 and **mainnet launch** after Week 5.
