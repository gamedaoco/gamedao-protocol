- VotingInterface (stake-weighted)
- DelegationManager
```

**Features:**
- **Stake-Weighted Voting**: Voting power based on GAME stakes
- **Proposal Staking**: Require governance staking for proposals
- **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to other users
- **Governance Analytics**: Participation rates, voting history

## üîß Technical Implementation

### GraphQL Queries Needed
```graphql
# Staking data queries
query UserStakes($user: Bytes!) {
  userStakes(where: { user: $user }) {
    pool { purpose, rewardRate, totalStaked }
    amount
    pendingRewards
    totalRewardsClaimed
    stakedAt
    lastClaimTime
  }
}

query StakingPools {
  stakingPools {
    purpose
    totalStaked
    rewardRate
    stakersCount
    totalRewardsDistributed
  }
}

query UnstakeRequests($user: Bytes!) {
  unstakeRequests(where: { userStake_: { user: $user }, processed: false }) {
    amount
    strategy
    unlockTime
    requestTime
  }
}
```

### Smart Contract Integration
```typescript
// Key contract interactions
const gameStaking = useContract('GameStaking')
const gameToken = useContract('MockGameToken')

// Staking operations
const stake = async (purpose, amount, strategy) => {
  await gameToken.approve(gameStaking.address, amount)
  await gameStaking.stake(purpose, amount, strategy)
}

const claimRewards = async (purpose) => {
  await gameStaking.claimRewards(purpose)
}

const requestUnstake = async (purpose, amount, strategy) => {
  await gameStaking.requestUnstake(purpose, amount, strategy)
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Redux/Zustand store structure
interface StakingState {
  pools: StakingPool[]
  userStakes: UserStake[]
  pendingRewards: Record<StakingPurpose, BigNumber>
  unstakeRequests: UnstakeRequest[]
  isLoading: boolean
  error: string | null
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### Design Principles
1. **Clarity First**: Make staking requirements and rewards crystal clear
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic info first, details on demand
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Emphasize high-APY pools and pending rewards
4. **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation flows
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure staking works perfectly on mobile

### Key Metrics to Display
- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Across all pools
- **Personal APY**: User's effective APY based on their stakes
- **Rewards Earned**: Historical and projected earnings
- **Pool Health**: Utilization rates and reward distribution

## üì± Mobile-First Considerations

### Critical Mobile Features
1. **Quick Actions**: Stake, claim, unstake in minimal taps
2. **Push Notifications**: Reward claims, unstake ready
3. **Offline Capability**: Cache balances and pool data
4. **Touch Optimization**: Large buttons, easy scrolling

## üîç Testing Strategy

### User Testing Focus Areas
1. **New User Onboarding**: Can users understand staking requirements?
2. **Staking Flow**: Is the stake/unstake process intuitive?
3. **Reward Claiming**: Do users understand when/how to claim?
4. **Strategy Selection**: Do users understand unstaking strategies?

## üìä Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Staking Adoption**: % of GAME holders who stake
- **Pool Utilization**: Distribution across different APY pools
- **Reward Claiming**: Frequency and efficiency of claims
- **User Retention**: Continued staking activity over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Recommended Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js for analytics
- **Web3**: Wagmi + Viem for contract interactions
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Client for subgraph queries

## ‚ö° Quick Wins (Week 1)

1. **Staking Pool Cards**: Show APY rates and total staked
2. **Balance Display**: GAME and USDC balances prominently
3. **Claim Button**: One-click reward claiming
4. **Basic Staking**: Simple stake interface for one pool

These quick wins will immediately demonstrate the tokenomics value to users while the full interface is being developed.

## üö® Critical Path Items

1. **Token Approvals**: Seamless ERC20 approval flows
2. **Real-time Data**: Live updates of stakes and rewards
3. **Error Handling**: Clear messaging for failed transactions
4. **Loading States**: Smooth UX during blockchain interactions

## üìÖ Timeline Summary

- **Week 1**: Basic staking dashboard and token management
- **Week 2**: Complete stake/unstake interface
- **Week 3**: DAO creation integration
- **Week 4**: Campaign interface updates
- **Week 5**: Advanced analytics
- **Week 6**: Governance integration and polish

This roadmap ensures users can immediately benefit from the tokenomics implementation while building toward a comprehensive staking and governance experience.
