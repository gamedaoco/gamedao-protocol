GameDAO is relaunching on Soneium in Q4 2025. We’re shipping a focused MVP: organizations with treasuries, crowdfunding campaigns, governance for settings and proposals, and staking-backed membership. The target is simple: fund a handful of Soneium-native games with transparent, milestone-based disbursements governed by their communities. Details and dates will be published in our upcoming series. If you’re building a game for Soneium and want structured funding and governance, get in touch.
