# Soneium Relaunch Docs

Naming convention for this folder:

- Files use hyphen-separated names with a continuous three-digit index prefix
- Pattern: `NNN-title.md` (e.g., `001-intro.md`)
- Purpose: maintain logical reading order independent of dates

Scope:
- Intro and blurb for external comms
- Roadmap of articles to publish
- Timing, features, and requirements outline
- Feature set reference for public statements

Editing rules:
- Keep tone factual; avoid unverified claims
- Use “Validate” flags for items requiring confirmation
- Link to canonical sources in `docs/` and to code where relevant
