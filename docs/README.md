## üìä Documentation Migration

This unified documentation structure was created on **2025-01-13** as part of a comprehensive reorganization that:

‚úÖ **Consolidated scattered documentation** from multiple locations
‚úÖ **Preserved all historical context** while improving organization
‚úÖ **Established clear categorization** for different documentation types
‚úÖ **Created standardized proposal system** for protocol governance
‚úÖ **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing references

### Migration Summary

**Files Moved to Unified Structure:**
- Historical logs: `logs/` ‚Üí `docs/logs/`
- Module documentation: `packages/pallets/*/README.md` ‚Üí `docs/development/modules/`
- Contract documentation: `packages/contracts-solidity/*.md` ‚Üí `docs/development/contracts/`
- Frontend documentation: `packages/frontend/*.md` ‚Üí `docs/development/frontend/`
- Development notes: `editor-notes.md` ‚Üí `docs/development/`
- Governance: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` ‚Üí `docs/`

**New Documentation Created:**
- 3 comprehensive GIP proposals for major features
- Enhanced battlepass design specification
- Detailed technical analysis documents
- Comprehensive README files for each section

## üéØ Key Features

### GameDAO Protocol Modules
1. **CONTROL** - DAO management and membership
2. **FLOW** - Crowdfunding and treasury management
3. **SIGNAL** - Governance and voting systems
4. **SENSE** - Identity and reputation tracking
5. **BATTLEPASS** - Gamified engagement system (planned)

### Major Proposals
- **GIP-002**: Battlepass Solidity Migration ($582k-$720k, 16 weeks)
- **GIP-003**: ERC-4337 Account Abstraction ($1.1M-$1.4M, 24 weeks)
- **GIP-004**: External Documentation Integration ($30k-$40k, 8 weeks)

### Development Status
- **Smart Contracts**: 9 contracts implemented with comprehensive testing
- **Frontend**: 65% complete with ongoing module integration
- **Infrastructure**: Full deployment pipeline and subgraph indexing
- **Documentation**: Unified system with historical preservation

## üìù Contributing

All documentation follows the established patterns and organization. When adding new documentation:

1. **Choose appropriate section**: Development, Protocol, Product, or GIPs
2. **Follow naming conventions**: Use PascalCase or camelCase, never snake_case
3. **Maintain historical context**: Reference related logs and previous work
4. **Use current dates**: Always use real current date, not backdated entries
5. **Update READMEs**: Keep section READMEs current with new additions

## üîç Search & Navigation

- **By Topic**: Use section-based navigation (Development, Protocol, Product, GIPs)
- **By Module**: All module docs are in `development/modules/`
- **By Date**: Historical logs are chronologically organized
- **By Status**: GIPs are organized by status (draft, active, final)
