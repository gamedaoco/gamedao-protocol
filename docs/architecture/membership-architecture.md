## Overview

GameDAO v3 implements a revolutionary **"Identity → Membership → Everything Else"** architecture that centralizes membership management while maintaining modularity and scalability. This design eliminates code duplication, reduces contract sizes, and provides a unified foundation for all protocol operations.

### Key Innovations

- **Centralized Membership**: Single source of truth for all membership operations
- **Governance-Controlled Settings**: Democratic control over organization parameters
- **Unified Reputation System**: Integrated reputation tracking across all modules
- **Voting Power Delegation**: Flexible delegation system with batch operations
- **Contract Size Optimization**: All contracts under 24KB deployment limit
- **End-to-End Integration**: Seamless frontend, subgraph, and contract integration

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Identity Layer**: Profile creation and management
- **Membership Layer**: Centralized membership operations
- **Module Layer**: Specialized functionality (governance, crowdfunding, etc.)
- **Support Layer**: Auxiliary services (treasury, staking, tokens)

### 2. Single Source of Truth
- All membership data flows through `GameDAOMembership` contract
- Eliminates duplicate membership logic across modules
- Ensures consistency in membership state and permissions

### 3. Governance-First Design
- All organization settings require community approval
- Emergency procedures with daily limits
- Complete audit trails for all governance actions

### 4. Scalability and Modularity
- New modules can easily integrate with existing membership system
- Flexible architecture supports future enhancements
- Efficient batch operations for large-scale operations

## Membership System

### Core Components

#### 1. Member Structure
```solidity
struct Member {
    address account;           // Member's wallet address
    bytes8 profileId;         // Linked profile ID
    MemberState state;        // Active, Paused, Kicked, Banned
    MembershipTier tier;      // Basic, Premium, VIP, Founder
    uint256 joinedAt;         // Join timestamp
    uint256 lastActiveAt;     // Last activity timestamp
    uint256 reputation;       // Reputation score (scaled by 1000)
    uint256 votingPower;      // Current voting power
    uint256 delegatedPower;   // Power delegated to others
    bool canVote;             // Voting permission
    bool canPropose;          // Proposal permission
    uint256 membershipFee;    // Fee paid to join
    bytes metadata;           // Additional metadata
}
```

#### 2. Membership States
- **Inactive (0)**: Not a member
- **Active (1)**: Full member with all permissions
- **Paused (2)**: Temporarily suspended
- **Kicked (3)**: Removed by governance
- **Banned (4)**: Permanently excluded

#### 3. Membership Tiers
- **Basic (0)**: Standard membership (1x voting power)
- **Premium (1)**: Enhanced membership (2x voting power)
- **VIP (2)**: Premium membership (3x voting power)
- **Founder (3)**: Founding member (5x voting power)

### Membership Operations

#### Adding Members
```solidity
function addMember(
    bytes8 organizationId,
    address member,
    bytes8 profileId,
    MembershipTier tier,
    uint256 membershipFee
) external returns (bool)
```

#### Voting Power Management
```solidity
function delegateVotingPower(
    bytes8 organizationId,
    address delegatee,
    uint256 amount
) external

function undelegateVotingPower(
    bytes8 organizationId,
    address delegatee,
    uint256 amount
) external
```

#### Reputation System
```solidity
function updateMemberReputation(
    bytes8 organizationId,
    address member,
    uint256 newReputation,
    bool isReward
) external

function applyReputationDecay(
    bytes8 organizationId,
    address member
) external
```

## Module Integration

### Control Module Integration
```solidity
// Before: Direct membership management
function addMember(bytes8 orgId, address member) external {
    members[orgId][member] = Member({...});
    // Duplicate logic across modules
}

// After: Membership delegation
function addMember(bytes8 orgId, address member, bytes8 profileId, MembershipTier tier, uint256 fee) external {
    require(membership.addMember(orgId, member, profileId, tier, fee), "Membership addition failed");
    // Organization-specific logic only
}
```

### Signal Module Integration
```solidity
// Before: Custom voting power calculation
function getVotingPower(bytes8 orgId, address member) external view returns (uint256) {
    Member memory memberData = members[orgId][member];
    return calculateVotingPower(memberData.tier, memberData.reputation);
}

// After: Centralized voting power
function getVotingPower(bytes8 orgId, address member) external view returns (uint256) {
    return membership.getVotingPower(orgId, member);
}
```

### Flow Module Integration
```solidity
// Before: Duplicate membership validation
modifier onlyMember(bytes8 orgId) {
    require(members[orgId][msg.sender].state == MemberState.Active, "Not active member");
    _;
}

// After: Centralized validation
modifier onlyMember(bytes8 orgId) {
    require(membership.isActiveMember(orgId, msg.sender), "Not active member");
    _;
}
```

## Data Flow

### 1. User Registration Flow
```
User → Frontend → Identity Contract → Profile Creation → IPFS Metadata Storage
```

### 2. Organization Creation Flow
```
User → Frontend → Control Contract → Organization Creation → Membership Registration
```

### 3. Membership Join Flow
```
User → Frontend → Control Contract → Membership Validation → GameDAOMembership Contract
```

### 4. Voting Flow
```
User → Frontend → Signal Contract → Membership Validation → Vote Recording → Reputation Reward
```

### 5. Campaign Contribution Flow
```
User → Frontend → Flow Contract → Membership Validation → Contribution Recording → Treasury Update
```

// New membership hook
const {
  isMember,
  isActiveMember,
  member,
  votingPower,
  reputation
} = useMembershipQueries(organizationId)

// Membership operations
const {
  addMember,
  removeMember,
  updateMemberState,
  delegateVotingPower
} = useMembership()
```

### Contract Integration
```typescript
// Centralized contract addresses
const contracts = useContracts()
const membershipContract = contracts.membership

// Unified membership validation
const canVote = await membershipContract.canVote(orgId, userAddress)
const canPropose = await membershipContract.canPropose(orgId, userAddress)
```

### Subgraph Integration
```graphql
# Unified membership queries
query GetMembership($orgId: String!, $member: String!) {
  membership(id: $orgId-$member) {
    state
    tier
    reputation
    votingPower
    delegatedPower
    canVote
    canPropose
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Role-based permissions**: Multiple admin roles with specific permissions
- **Organization-level controls**: Admins can only manage their organizations
- **Emergency procedures**: Daily limits and multi-signature requirements

### Reentrancy Protection
- **ReentrancyGuard**: All state-changing functions protected
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Proper ordering of operations
- **Batch operation safety**: Atomic batch operations

### Input Validation
- **Address validation**: Zero address checks
- **Range validation**: Reputation and voting power bounds
- **State validation**: Proper state transitions

### Governance Security
- **Democratic control**: All settings require community approval
- **Emergency limits**: Daily limits on emergency actions
- **Audit trails**: Complete history of all governance actions

## Performance Optimizations

### Contract Size Optimization
- **Eliminated duplication**: Centralized membership logic
- **Optimized storage**: Efficient mapping structures
- **Batch operations**: Reduced gas costs for multiple operations

### Gas Efficiency
