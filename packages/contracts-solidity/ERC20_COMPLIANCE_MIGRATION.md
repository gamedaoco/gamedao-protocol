# ERC20 Compliance Migration - GameDAO v3

## Overview

This document outlines the successful migration from a non-standard ERC20 token with built-in staking to a compliant ERC20 token with a dedicated GameStaking contract.

## Problem Statement

The original `MockGameToken` contract had several compliance issues:

1. **ERC20 Standard Violation**: Built-in staking functionality is not part of the ERC20 standard
2. **Transfer Restrictions**: The `_beforeTokenTransfer` override prevented transferring staked tokens
3. **DeFi Integration Issues**: Non-standard behavior broke compatibility with DeFi protocols
4. **Composability Problems**: Custom token behavior limited integration possibilities

## Solution Architecture

### New Contract Structure

1. **MockGameToken.sol** - Clean, standard ERC20 implementation
2. **GameStaking.sol** - Dedicated staking contract with advanced features
3. **Control.sol** - Updated to use GameStaking for organization creation
4. **IGameStaking.sol** - Interface for staking functionality
5. **IGameToken.sol** - Clean ERC20 interface (renamed from IGameTokenClean.sol)

### Key Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Full ERC20 Compliance**: Standard token behavior, no transfer restrictions
- ✅ **Enhanced Staking Features**: Rewards, slashing, flexible unstaking strategies
- ✅ **Better DeFi Integration**: Token works with all standard DeFi protocols
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of token logic from staking logic
- ✅ **Upgradability**: Staking contract can be upgraded independently

## Implementation Details

### 1. Clean ERC20 Token

**File**: `contracts/mocks/MockGameToken.sol`

```solidity
contract MockGameToken is ERC20, AccessControl, Pausable {
    // Standard ERC20 with minting, burning, and pause functionality
    // No staking functionality - clean and compliant
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Standard ERC20 implementation
- Minting and burning capabilities
- Pause functionality for emergency stops
- No transfer restrictions
- 1M initial supply, 100M max supply

### 2. Enhanced GameStaking Contract

**File**: `contracts/staking/GameStaking.sol`

```solidity
contract GameStaking is AccessControl, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable {
    // Organization-specific staking
    function stakeForOrganization(bytes8 organizationId, address staker, uint256 amount) external;
    function withdrawOrganizationStake(bytes8 organizationId, address staker) external;

    // General staking with rewards
    function stake(StakingPurpose purpose, uint256 amount, UnstakingStrategy strategy) external;
    function requestUnstake(StakingPurpose purpose, uint256 amount, UnstakingStrategy strategy) external;
    function claimRewards(StakingPurpose purpose) external;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Organization-specific staking with 30-day lock period
- Multiple staking purposes (Governance, DAO Creation, Treasury Bond, Liquidity Mining)
- Flexible unstaking strategies (Rage Quit, Standard, Patient)
- Reward distribution system
- Slashing capabilities
- Role-based access control

### 3. Updated Control Module

**File**: `contracts/modules/Control/Control.sol`

**Changes**:
- Constructor now takes both `gameToken` and `gameStaking` addresses
- Organization creation uses `gameStaking.stakeForOrganization()`
- Stake withdrawal uses `gameStaking.withdrawOrganizationStake()`
- Added helper functions for stake management

**New Flow**:
1. User approves Control contract to spend GAME tokens
2. Control transfers tokens and creates stake in GameStaking
3. GameStaking holds tokens and tracks organization-specific stakes
4. After lock period and organization dissolution, stakes can be withdrawn

### 4. Subgraph Integration

**Updated Schema**: `packages/subgraph/schema.graphql`

New entities:
- `OrganizationStake` - Tracks organization creation stakes
- `UserStake` - Tracks general user stakes
- `UnstakeRequest` - Tracks unstaking requests
- `StakingPool` - Tracks staking pools by purpose

**New Handler**: `packages/subgraph/src/staking.ts`

Handles all GameStaking events:
- `OrganizationStaked` / `OrganizationStakeWithdrawn`
- `Staked` / `Unstaked`
- `RewardsClaimed` / `Slashed`

### 5. Frontend Integration

**Updated Files**:
- `packages/frontend/src/lib/contracts.ts` - Added GAME_STAKING address
- `packages/frontend/src/lib/abis.ts` - Added GAME_STAKING_ABI

**New Contract Integration**:
- GameStaking contract for organization stakes
- Clean ERC20 interface for token operations
- Updated contract addresses and ABIs

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Contract Development ✅
- [x] Create clean ERC20 GameToken
- [x] Enhance GameStaking contract with organization functionality
- [x] Update Control module to use GameStaking
- [x] Create proper interfaces

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Updates ✅
- [x] Update subgraph schema and handlers
- [x] Update frontend contracts and ABIs
- [x] Update deployment scripts
- [x] Add GameStaking ABI to subgraph

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (In Progress)
- [ ] Fix contract size issues (Control contract exceeds 24KB limit)
- [ ] Update and fix contract tests
- [ ] Update scaffold script for new architecture
- [ ] Full integration testing

## Usage Examples

### Organization Creation (New Flow)

```typescript
// 1. Approve Control contract to spend GAME tokens
await gameToken.approve(controlAddress, stakeAmount);

// 2. Create organization (Control handles staking internally)
await control.createOrganization(
  "My DAO",
  "ipfs://metadata",
  orgType,
  accessModel,
  feeModel,
  memberLimit,
  membershipFee,
  stakeAmount
);
```

### Stake Withdrawal

```typescript
// 1. Check if stake can be withdrawn
const canWithdraw = await control.canWithdrawStake(organizationId);

// 2. Withdraw stake (after lock period and organization dissolution)
await control.withdrawStake(organizationId);
```

### General Staking

```typescript
// 1. Approve GameStaking contract
await gameToken.approve(gameStakingAddress, amount);

// 2. Stake for specific purpose
await gameStaking.stake(
  StakingPurpose.GOVERNANCE,
  amount,
  UnstakingStrategy.STANDARD
);

// 3. Claim rewards
await gameStaking.claimRewards(StakingPurpose.GOVERNANCE);
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Old System (MockGameToken) | New System (GameToken + GameStaking) |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Token Standard | Non-standard ERC20 | Standard ERC20 |
| Staking Location | Built into token | Separate contract |
| Transfer Restrictions | Blocks staked token transfers | No restrictions |
| Staking Features | Basic stake/unstake | Advanced: rewards, slashing, strategies |
| DeFi Compatibility | Limited | Full compatibility |
| Upgradability | Requires token migration | Staking contract upgradeable |
| Organization Stakes | Direct token transfers | Dedicated staking mechanism |

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Contract Size Optimization
- **Issue**: Control contract exceeds 24KB size limit
- **Status**: In progress
- **Solution**: Optimize contract size or split functionality

### 2. Contract Tests
- **Issue**: Tests need updating for new architecture
- **Status**: Partially complete
- **Solution**: Update test setup and fix deployment issues

### 3. Frontend Hooks
- **Issue**: React hooks need updating for GameStaking
- **Status**: Pending
- **Solution**: Update hooks to use new contract structure

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to .env files
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_STAKING_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### Contract Addresses (Localhost)
```json
{
  "GameToken": "0x7a2088a1bFc9d81c55368AE168C2C02570cB814F",
  "GameStaking": "0xc5a5C42992dECbae36851359345FE25997F5C42d",
  "Control": "0x...", // Pending deployment fix
  "GameDAORegistry": "0x67d269191c92Caf3cD7723F116c85e6E9bf55933"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Optimize Contract Size**: Reduce Control contract size to under 24KB
2. **Complete Testing**: Fix and update all contract tests
3. **Update Frontend Hooks**: Implement GameStaking integration in React hooks
4. **Full Integration Test**: Test complete flow from frontend to subgraph
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation and user guides

## Security Considerations

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin standards
- Role-based access control implemented
- Reentrancy protection in place
- Pause functionality for emergency stops
- Comprehensive event logging for transparency

## Conclusion

The migration successfully achieves full ERC20 compliance while maintaining all existing functionality and adding enhanced staking capabilities. The new architecture provides better separation of concerns, improved DeFi compatibility, and a foundation for future enhancements.
