# ZERO SENSE

1.6 Identity

Every entity in ZERO METAVERSE needs to provide initial identity information to create an ecosystem wide decentralised identity (DID). This allows for platform operation in a legal manner, provides transparency and guarantees for the community.

The identity system is bound to ZERO as a network layer, which provides identity and payment flow for all participants.

Identity is cryptographically abstracted away to make it inefficient to reveal private data of a user without its consent.

In certain cases, users are required to reveal their identity to proceed in e.g. monetary transactions (KYC/AML) or audits when participating in certain protocol execution.

Identity comes with additional features for the ecosystems connected to ZERO, namely trust, reputation and experience metrics, which are powered by:

- Provision of social identifiers strengthening the Trust (T) level of an identity
- Continuous contribution of activity into their experience levels (XP)
- Social feedback of other ecosystem participants, contributing to the reputation (REP) of an identity

These all together, T, XP, REP and the opaque identity provide increased trust and protection of the user base, enabling barrier free interaction, in case of GameDAO for coordination and fundraising.
